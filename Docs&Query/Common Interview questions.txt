1. Find the second highest salary from the employee table:

Explanation: Use a subquery to first get the distinct salaries and then select the second highest.


SELECT MAX(salary) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM employees
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);


2. Find employees whose salary is greater than the average salary of all employees:

Explanation: First, compute the average salary using a subquery, then find employees earning more than that.


SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);


3. List the employees who work in the same department as an employee named 'John':

Explanation: Use a subquery to find John's department and then select all employees from the same department.


SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = (SELECT department_id FROM employees WHERE name = 'John');


4. Display departments that have no employees assigned:

Explanation: Use a subquery with NOT EXISTS to find departments without matching employees.


SELECT department_name
FROM departments d
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM employees e WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id);


5. For each department, find the employee with the highest salary:

Explanation: Use a correlated subquery to find the employee with the maximum salary in each department.


SELECT name, department_id, salary
FROM employees e
WHERE salary = (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees WHERE department_id = e.department_id);


6. List employees who do not have a manager assigned:

Explanation: Use a subquery to find employees whose manager_id is NULL.


SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE manager_id IS NULL;


7. Find the Nth highest salary in the employee table:

Explanation: Use a subquery with DISTINCT salaries and limit the result to get the Nth highest.


SELECT salary
FROM (
    SELECT salary, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank
    FROM employees
) AS ranked_salaries
WHERE rank = N;
